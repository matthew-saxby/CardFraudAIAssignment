Intro to Data Science
Reflection on AI 

Using AI really helped me with specific code implementations when I had ideas floating around in my head. It sped up my coding process and made solving problems easier. I can imagine that if someone without a solid grasp of Data Science was trying to put this notebook together, they could easily misinterpret the data. Thanks to what I learned in this class, I realized the importance of doing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and other checks before jumping into model creation.

There were definitely times when the AI tried to help with modeling or data preprocessing, but it sometimes ran into issues or introduced bugs into my code. Because I had some experience with AI before, I knew to double-check the code for logical errors. I also learned about common bugs that can pop up, like using misnamed variables. These experiences made me more aware and helped me verify the outputs from ChatGPT.
